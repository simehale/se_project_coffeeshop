# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

1. I noticed that the header scetion would displace the content upon minimizing the window layout. I would like to solve this responsiveness issue in the future. I persume it has something to with unspecified boundary markers within the css code.
2. The animation in the about section is a bit clunky, and would like to improve it's smoothness. Normally it wouldn't be an issue, but the abrupt keyframe cut from 100% to 0% can be a distraction in the corner of the eye. It could also cause an unpleasant sensitivity to the user's peripheral as I'm noticing the negative effect firsthand. Adding reverse transition property or fade at the end could potentially clean up the visual.
